# Wind-Notifier

## Introduction

This application works from Android version 4.4 on both smartphone and tablet. 

This application offers a user interface, displaying JSON data from an anemometer placed on the shoreline. An HTTP request is sent and the relevant data is processed. 

Using java threads, the application can run in the background on the terminal and perform its HTTP requests at regular intervals.

An option allows the user to receive notifications if a wind threshold is exceeded. The threshold is chosen by the user with a cursor. 

Widgets are added to display additional data such as tide schedules or weather forecasts.

The weather is only a pretext to build a dynamic application, it can be easily adapted to other APIs providing a JSON file, in the field of robotics in particular the applications of this project are numerous.
